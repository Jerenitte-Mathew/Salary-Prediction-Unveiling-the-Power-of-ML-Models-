# Salary-Prediction-Unveiling-the-Power-of-ML-Models

🔍 Mission: Predict salary based on experience using different ML models & find the best one!

🛠️ Workflow:
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis – Understanding salary trends

🔹 Visual Insights – Bar charts on experience vs. salary

🔹 Model Showdown – Linear Regression vs. Decision Tree vs. Random Forest vs. SVM

🔹 Performance Battle – R² Score, MAE, MSE & RMSE

🔹 Crowning the Winner 👑

🚀 Let’s Talk Numbers! 📉

Model Performance Summary 📊  
--------------------------------------  
📌 Linear Regression       | R²: 0.76   | MAE: 6185.99  | RMSE: 7165.05  
🌳 Decision Tree           | R²: 0.51   | MAE: 8985.42  | RMSE: 10239.36  
🌲 Random Forest           | R²: 0.49   | MAE: 8346.77  | RMSE: 10445.14  
❌ SVM Regressor           | R²: -1.78  | MAE: 19986.23 | RMSE: 24475.35  
--------------------------------------  
🏆 Verdict: Linear Regression emerges as the champion!
📌 Highest R² Score
📌 Lowest MAE & RMSE
📌 Simple yet effective!

💡 Lesson? More complex models don't always mean better performance. Sometimes, the basics get the job done!
